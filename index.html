       <p>Hello, my name is Bobby. I am an emerging professional in a workforce training program called Year up where I am studying Software and App development. 5 weeks ago I had no technical understanding of any Software development, now I can see a path to proficiency.</p>
       
       <p>Even though I didn't ever see myself pursuing this line of education, I'm learning that everything I've experienced in life is an asset going forward</p>
       
       <p>Throughout my life, I've been a part of sports teams, and Kitchen crews. Both have equipped me with strong communication and leadership skills that I never thought would be useful again. I thought I was starting from zero with my education and felt behind people younger and smarter than me. I now realize that I have skills and experiences that others may not, and that I can bring something to the table.</p>
       
       <p>I have a passion for team sports, specifically soccer, which I've played, and coached my whole life. and enjoy collaborating toward a shared goal.I believe my communication and leadership skills would be an asset to any company.
    </p>
           
      <p>In 5 years I'd love to be a valued member of a team working for growth personally and together. I'd love to connect with you on Linkedin. </p>
